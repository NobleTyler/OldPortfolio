![HomePage](https://nobletyler.github.io/Projects/Portfolio/portfolio.png?raw=true)
## How do I run it
```
git clone https://github.com/NobleTyler/OldPortfolio.git
cd OldPortfolio
npm install
npm start
```
It will then redirect your favourite web browser to the site where you can check it out.
In order to run mongoDB you should use [this guide.](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-mongodb-a4ce205e7739/)
*Note the database must be seeded in order to see anything, but you can still see how it works from there.
